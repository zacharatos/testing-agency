# Superheroes Agency

Welcome to the Superheroes Agency project repository! This project aims to create a .NET-based application for managing special agents and superheroes, applying various best practices, design patterns, and tools.

## Project Overview

### Design Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern**: We will utilize the Decorator Pattern to dynamically add additional behaviors or features to our special agents and superheroes.

- **Repository Pattern**: The Repository Pattern will be employed to abstract the data access layer, making it easier to work with various data sources.

- **Mediator Pattern**: The Mediator Pattern will help facilitate communication between components in a decoupled manner.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **.NET Core**: We're building this project with the latest .NET Core (or .NET 5+) framework for high performance and cross-platform compatibility. [Official Website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

- **Swagger**: We'll use Swagger for API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with our APIs. [Official Website](https://swagger.io/)

- **Entity Framework Core**: Entity Framework Core is our choice for data access, enabling efficient database operations and migrations. [Official Website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)

- **Serilog**: To log important events in our application, we'll use Serilog, which offers flexibility and extensibility. [Official Website](https://serilog.net/)

- **MediatR**: MediatR is a simple library to implement the Mediator Pattern in .NET, facilitating communication between application components. [Official Website](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)

- **FluentValidation**: For input validation and data validation, FluentValidation is a powerful library that integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core. [Official Website](https://fluentvalidation.net/)

- **Automapper**: Automapper simplifies object-to-object mapping, making it easier to transform data between DTOs and domain models. [Official Website](https://automapper.org/)

### Best Practices

- **Dependency Injection**: We use built-in .NET Core DI to manage dependencies efficiently.

- **RESTful APIs**: Our project will provide RESTful APIs with proper request/response structures.

- **Caching**: We'll implement caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Asynchronous operations will be used for I/O-bound tasks to maintain a responsive API.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: OAuth2 or JWT tokens will be employed to secure our APIs.

- **Unit Testing**: We'll write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: A CI/CD pipeline will automate building, testing, and deployment.

- **Code Quality and Style**: We'll maintain code quality using tools like ReSharper or StyleCop.

- **Code Reviews**: Encourage peer code reviews to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.

- **Security**: Implement security best practices, including input validation and encryption.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerting for proactive issue identification.
